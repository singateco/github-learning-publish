# JSP action tags

```jsp
<jsp:forward page="printdate.jsp"> 
<jsp:param name = "param_name" value = "value_of_parameter">
<jsp:include page="header.jsp" flush="false">
<jsp:useBean id="unique_name_to_identify_bean" class="package_name.class_name">
<jsp:setProperty name="property_name" property="property_value">
<jsp:getProperty name="property_name" property="property_value">
```

# Cookie

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie

- plaintext로 저장
- 4kb 한계가 있음
- 사용자 환경에 저장 (브라우저가 관리)

## jsp 에서 쿠키 사용법

1. 쿠키 객체 생성
2. 쿠키에 속성 값 저장.
3. addCookie()를 호출해 쿠키 추가

### 쿠키 생성

```jsp
<%
	// 쿠키 객체 생성
	Cookie c = new Cookie("id", "soldesk");

	// 유효 시간 설정
	c.setMaxAge(60*60);
	
	// 클라이언트에 쿠키 전송
	response.addCookie(c);
%>
```

### 쿠키 읽기

```jsp
<%
	Cookie[] cookies = request.getCookies();

	for (Cookie c: cookies) {
		out.print(c.getName() + " : " + c.getValue() + "<br>");
	}
%>
```

# 세션

- 서버에 저장
- 용량에 한계 없음
- 브라우저 단위로 한 개씩 존재

## Session infos

```jsp
<%
	String id = session.getId();
	long lasttime = session.getLastAccessedTime(); // 마지막으로 액세스한 시간 (milliseconds)
	long created = session.getCreationTime();
	long time = (lasttime - created) / 60000;
	
	int in = session.getMaxInactiveInterval() / 60; // 세션의 유효 시간
	boolean b = session.isNew(); // 세션이 새로 만들어졌는지
%>
```

# Javabeans

JavaBeans is a Java-based software ==component model== that is used to create reusable software components for Java applications. It is a ==specification for creating Java classes== that can be easily manipulated visually in a ==builder tool==, and that conform to certain design patterns, such as being serializable, having a nullary constructor, and allowing access to properties using getter and setter methods. JavaBeans are typically used to build user interfaces and other reusable software components.

## JavaBeans Classes convention

1.  It should have a nullary constructor.
2.  It should have getter and setter methods for properties.
3.  It should be serializable, although this is not a must but it's a good practice.
4.  It should be a plain old java object (POJO) with private properties and public getters and setters.
5.  It should be thread-safe, although this is not a requirement but it's a good practice.
6.  It should allow the properties to be bound to other components, although this is not a requirement but it's a good practice.

## Why use JavaBeans?

1.  Reusability: JavaBeans are reusable software components that can be easily integrated into web applications, which promotes code reusability and reduces development time.
2.  Separation of concerns: JavaBeans provide a clean separation between the presentation and the business logic of a web application, which makes it easier to maintain and update the application.
3.  Data binding: JavaBeans can be used to bind data to the user interface components of a web application, which allows for easy manipulation and display of data.
4.  Event-driven programming: JavaBeans can generate events and respond to events, which enables event-driven programming in web applications.
5.  Framework support: Many web development frameworks such as JavaServer Faces (JSF) and JavaServer Pages (JSP) are built on top of the JavaBeans model, so developers can use these frameworks to build web applications quickly and easily.
6.  Tool support: The JavaBeans conventions make it possible for tools such as visual editors, IDE's and other tools to automatically generate code, providing a very efficient development process.


## JavaBeans Class Example

```java
public class PersonBean {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    // a nullary constructor is required
    public PersonBean() {}

    // getter and setter methods for the properties
    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

    public void setAge(int age) {
        this.age = age;
    }
}
```


## Using JavaBeans in JSP

```jsp
<jsp:useBean id="mem" class="bean.MemberBean"/>
<!-- is same as MemberBean mem = new MemberBean() -->
<jsp:setProperty property="name" name="mem" value="건상"/>
이름 : <jsp:getProperty property="name" name="mem"/>
```

## Request automapping

```jsp
<jsp:useBean id="sbean" class="bean.StuBean">
<!-- response에서 받은 값이 stuBean 클래스의 필드값과 같으면 자동으로 매핑된다 -->
<jsp:setProperty name="sbean" property="*"/>
</jsp:useBean>
```
